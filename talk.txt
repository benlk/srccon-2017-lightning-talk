I was working on a site (I think it was TCR, but I don't remember and wouldn't mention it by name anyways.) that for some reason wasn't being deployed using our normal deploy tools workflow. We were downloading the files via SFTP, editing them, and then pushing them back up by hand, instead of using the deploy tool built for that purpose. Sometimes things weren't getting checked into version control. it was a mess that we have since resolved.
The client requested a hot fix, and I wasn't sure what was safe to edit, or whether it was safe to deploy onto the site. So I downloaded the site's functions.php file, which if you don't know WordPress sets up the functionality of the theme that determines how the site looks. I made the change, tested it on my local development server, added a comment, saved the file, and pushed it back up to the production server.
I use vim as a text editor. To save a file in vim, you press the escape key, and then colon w q. It saves the file and quits. After a while, it becomes muscle memory.
But I was doing that edit using the Mac default text editor, TextEdit.app. So I pressed <esc>:wq and nothing happened, and I remembered that I was using TextEdit, so I pressed command-S, command-Q, and finished what I was doing. But in Textedit, when you press <esc>, it goes to the top of the file, and ignores the next character input. The colon did nothing. Then you press W, and that goes into the file. And Q, and that goes into the file, and it's doing this all at the top of functions.php, before the part of the file that tells the PHP interpreter to not output stuff to the page.
The next morning, at the top of the webpage, before the HTML started, there was this little white bar with 12pt black text saying: wq
And after that we got the site back under version control, and had some talks about deploy tools. This is a long way of saying: don't break your processes. And if you have to, be extra, extra sure.
